WP Time Slots Booking Form creates booking forms for booking time slots into the calendar dates.

== Description ==

WP Time Slots Booking Form creates booking forms for booking time slots into the calendar dates.  Basically you can create a form with a calendar where the end-user can pick times into the calendar dates and book them. Notifications emails are sent to let the admin know that a booking was completed and confirmation email can be sent also to the user making the booking.

This type of booking is useful for reserving classrooms, purchasing event tickets, medical / doctors appointments, booking times in escape rooms, booking personal coaching or other professional assistance, booking cleaning services and any other type of service where the customer needs to select a date-time or a group of date-times (time slots) from a set of available times.

In the calendar you can setup:

* The available time slots for each weekday
* The available time slots on specific dates
* The capacity (# of persons that can book) of each time slot 
* The number of different time slots that can be selected in a single booking
* Min and maximum available dates
* Holiday / closed dates
* Price for each time slot
* Prices for different number of selected slots
* Prices for (example) the number of adults and number of children (optional)
* Number of months to display
* ... and other calendar features

In addition to the calendar-related features, other important features of the plugin are:
 
* Modern look / mobile friendly
* Responsive calendar and form 
* Visual form builder 
* Multi language support
* Notification emails
* Antispam features
* Email reports
* CSV reports
* Usage / Stats area
* Bookings list
* Printable schedule list 
* Multi-View calendar for displaying schedule
* Integration with Elementor, Gutemberg and other page builders
* Add-ons support with iCal add-on included
 
The plugin properly manages the availability of each time slot, allowing to define a maximum capacity for each time slot and to define also the maximum number of time slots that the customer can select for the booking. 

You can optionally allow multiple persons to book the same time-slots until its capacity become fully filled. The plugin allows to setup different prices for two groups (example: adults and children) and features other options that make it appropriate for purchasing even tickets or other activities / items with multiple capacity.

= Q: I'm not receiving the emails with the appointment data. =

A: Try first using a "from" email address that belongs to your website domain, this is the most common restriction applied in most hosting services.

If that doesn't work please check if your hosting service requires some specific configuration to send emails from PHP/WordPress websites. The plugin uses the settings specified into the WordPress website to deliver the emails, if your hosting has some specific requirements like a fixed "from" address or a custom "SMTP" server those settings must be configured into the WordPress website.

= Q: About changing styles of the dates depending of the amount of booked/available bookings =

A: You can set a different color/style of the dates depending of the number of booked/available slots for that date so the user can get an idea of the amount of spaces available without clicking the date. This feature is useful for example to indicate to the customers the dates where there are few slots available so they know to hurry up.
